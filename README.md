## Background
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the 
same way that a person would execute a process. This usually refers to, what we would call, 
‘front-end’ or UI (User Interface) automation. RPA is often used to automate time-consuming and 
highly repetitive tasks to allow people the availed capacity to work on more intuitive tasks.

## About the Project
This project automates the populating, reading, updating, and reading of data in the 
https://connectedoffice-devicemanagement.azurewebsites.net/ web application. 

## How Stakeholders should use the solution
Since this application was created using UIPath community studio in conjuction with the Firefox
browser, the stakeholder should have these two applications on their machine. The automation solution
comes with the login credentials (username: L.wizard.h@gmail.com, password: Lehlohonolo@21), and the user
should not worry about needing to insert the login credentials because the automation solution has them
already. All that the stakeholder needs to do is to run the automation inside of UIPath studio community.
The automation solution will run, taking input from the excel and populating the database tables with it.
The tables will then be updated and deleted automatically.
